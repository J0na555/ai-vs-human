AI vs Human is a web-based game where users try to guess whether a displayed image was generated by AI or a human.  
The project includes:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the game interface.  
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express to serve the frontend and provide a random image API.  
- **Images:** Stored in categorized folders (`ai` and `human`) and served dynamically via the backend.

This project demonstrates **full-stack development**, static file serving, and basic API endpoints.
